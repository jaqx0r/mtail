# Example source-to-program mapping configuration
# Maps log sources to specific mtail programs

# How to handle log sources with no explicit mapping
# Valid values: "all" (process with all programs) or "none" (ignore)
unmapped_behavior: "all"

# Mappings from log sources to program names
mappings:
  - source: "/var/log/apache2/access.log"
    programs:
      - "apache_common.mtail"
      - "apache_combined.mtail"
  
  - source: "/var/log/mysql/slow-query.log"
    programs:
      - "mysql_slowqueries.mtail"
  
  - source: "/var/log/syslog"
    programs:
      - "linecount.mtail"

  # You can use glob patterns as sources
  - source: "/var/log/nginx/*.log"
    programs:
      - "nginx.mtail"
